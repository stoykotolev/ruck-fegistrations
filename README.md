# Ruck Fegistrations

Have you ever though "Damn, I'd really like to go and check me some Twitter drama."
Or tried opening amazing twitter profiles such as [https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/] to check and see what's the latest shitpost?
But are always welcomed by a pesky popup, promting you to either login or register, making it impossible to actually browse Twitter, without having a profie, which you refuse to have, just out of spite and the promise to yourself to never join that cesspool?

No, just me?

Well, do _I_ have great news for **me** then.

I present to you Ruck Fegistrations.
An amazing chrome extension that automatically hides the pesky popup and allows you to freely browse Twitter, without having to register.

That's it. Thank me later
